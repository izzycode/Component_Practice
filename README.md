# Components

Now that we know how components work we are going to get some practice _translating_ our **Portfolio Website** to a **Component** architecture.
 - Clone this repository into your computer.
 - Then go ahead and split every section of your Portfolio Site into components. Don't forget to import and export components.
 - You should be able to run your local Javascript server (`npm start` or `yarn start`) without seeing any errors.
 - The code for the `Project` component is already provided. You still need to create the `Projects` _component_ that will render many of `Product`.
 - When you are done and able to run your server without any errors, **push** your code to github and post the URL to your repository in the submission field in GoodMeasure.

**DO NOT** copy and paste code while working on this exercise since the whole purpose of the it is to create muscle memory by typing everything out.
You **DO NOT** need to change anything in the existing code. Only add code.

This is not a hard exercise but it requires some time.
